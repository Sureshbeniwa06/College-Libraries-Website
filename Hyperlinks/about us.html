In dictionaries the word “library” has been defined as “a building or room containing a collection of books”. A library renders a great service to the society. There are a large number of Public Libraries maintained by the local authorities throughout the island.

 A library plays a very important role in promoting the progress of knowledge. There are many people who love reading. But they can’t afford to buy books because the prices of books are very high. So when one becomes a member of a library, he can borrow valuable books. A member can borrow two books at a time and he can keep it with him for two weeks. Libraries are particularly useful for poor children. Even those who are better off can’t afford to buy all the books they require for their studies. For instance, invaluable books like Encyclopedias and large dictionaries cannot be purchased.

 A public library is a place that is open to poor and rich alike. There are mainly two sections in a library. They are the lending section and the reference section. Any member can borrow books from the lending section. Nonmembers too can use the reference section. They are allowed to enter the section free of charge. They can takedown notes from the books. In addition to these two sections, there is another section in a library. Here any one can do his or her studies under a calm and quiet environment. This section is called “The study room”. Some students find it very difficult to do their studies at their homes due to various reasons. This section is particularly useful for such students.
 A library is very useful for rural youths too. If they take to reading they will be able to refrain from evil habits such as loitering and gambling</p></div>
